# github-autolink-rewrite

github-autolink-rewrite is a simple utility to rewrite your github autolinks after a Jira or similar migration.

## Autocomplete

The tool uses your github token to fetch a list of your organizations and repositories. This allows you to select one from the CLI. 


![Example Org Autocomplete](./images/orgs.png)

```text
? Which organization are we working with? ›
❯   alexbbt
    bell-towne-films
    file-in-the-hole
```

![Example Repo Autocomplete](./images/repos.png)

```text
? Which repository would you like to update? ›
❯   alexander.bell-towne.com
    app.bell-towne.com
    wedding.bell-towne.com
    blog.bell-towne.com
    video-portal
    www.bell-towne.com
    http.bell-towne.com
```


## Usage

Create a token on [github.com](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with repo read/write access. This is enough for our usage. Then run the tool and paste in the token. This token can be deleted as soon as the tool is finished running.

I am going to ask you some questions to get to build the rewite plan.
Feel free to quit at any time. No changes will be made until you confirm the plan.
